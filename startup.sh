# $0 is a single script to setup the shell environment for the
# kartograafr application to run in multiple differetn runtime
# environments (command line or Docker container).
#
# An explicit setup makes it easy to:
# 1) run in Docker or from the command line with little change,
# 2) simulate the very limited shell environment provided by cron in Docker.

# This currently recognizes Docker and OSX environments.  It does not
# need to distingish between OpenShift and other Docker environments.

# Command line arguments passed to startup.sh will be passed along to kartograafr.

# Because of the dependency on the new ESRI ArcGIS Python API the script must be
# run with an Anaconda virtual invironment.  The Dockerfile shows how that can be
# setup for Linux.  An OSX installation can be modeled on that.

## Environment variables.  The USE_CONDA_ENV value must be set when the script is invoked.
### USE_CONDA_ENV - external,required - set to name of the conda environment to use.  E.g. py35
### USE_CONDA_PATH - internal - will be set to the full path of the anaconda environment.
### CONDA_PREFIX - automatic - set by the current external conda environment if one is active.

# set -x
# Terminate if there are any errors.
set -e

# Start out with these default settings suitable for the Docker configuration.
